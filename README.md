### 1. Setup AWS Amplify
- Initialize the project:
  ```bash
  amplify init
  ```
- Add authentication:
  ```bash
  amplify add auth
  ```
- Deploy the backend:
  ```bash
  amplify push
  ```

### 2. Configure User Authentication with AWS Cognito
- Use the Amplify CLI to create an authentication service.
- Integrate AWS Cognito with the front-end using the Amplify library for user sign-up, sign-in, and authentication flow.

### 3. Create S3 Buckets for Image Storage
- Create an S3 bucket in the AWS console for storing uploaded images.
- Configure the bucket policy to allow access from your application.

### 4. Develop Frontend with React
- Setup a React project:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app serverless-image-upload
  ```
- Install Amplify and AWS SDK:
  ```bash
  npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
  ```
- Integrate Amplify in your React app for authentication and S3 interactions.

### 5. Implement Image Upload Feature
- Create a file input form to upload images.
- Use Amplify Storage to upload images to S3:
  ```javascript
  import { Storage } from 'aws-amplify';

  const uploadImage = async (file) => {
    try {
      const result = await Storage.put(file.name, file, {
        contentType: file.type,
      });
      console.log('Uploaded:', result);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
    }
  };
  ```

### 6. Setup AWS Lambda for Image Processing
- Create a Lambda function to process images (e.g., resize, watermark).
- Use the AWS SDK to get images from S3, process them, and save the processed images back to S3.

### 7. Trigger Lambda with S3 Events
- Configure S3 to trigger the Lambda function on image upload:
  ```json
  {
    "LambdaFunctionConfigurations": [
      {
        "LambdaFunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name",
        "Events": ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### 8. Store Image Metadata in DynamoDB
- Create a DynamoDB table to store image metadata (e.g., URL, size, upload date).
- Update the Lambda function to save metadata to DynamoDB after processing.

### 9. Monitor and Log with CloudWatch and CloudTrail
- Enable CloudWatch logs for your Lambda function to monitor execution.
- Use CloudTrail to log API calls and track user activities.

### 10. Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation
- Define your AWS resources in a CloudFormation template:
  ```yaml
  Resources:
    S3Bucket:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
      Properties:
        BucketName: !Sub '${AWS::StackName}-bucket'
    ImageProcessingLambda:
      Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
      Properties:
        Handler: index.handler
        Role: !GetAtt LambdaExecutionRole.Arn
        Code:
          S3Bucket: !Ref DeploymentBucket
          S3Key: lambda/image-processing.zip
        Runtime: nodejs14.x
  ```
